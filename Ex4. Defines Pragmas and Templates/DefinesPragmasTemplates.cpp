// 1) The program currently doesn't compile, try to figure out why that is

// 2) Create a templated c function that multiplies 2 numbers a and b, and also multiplies x and y

// 3) Define a log function for 4 variables

// 4) as a, b, x, y are constant we want to define them instead of declaring them
